# NCKU_Computer-Architecture

## Homework 1  
In this assignment, you will complete three exercises by implementing inline assembly in aC program. The goal is to practice low-level programming and understand how assemblyinteracts with C.  
Exercise 1 (Array Bubble Sort, 20%): Implement the bubble sort algorithm using inlineassembly to sort an array of integers.  
Exercise 2 (Array Search, 40%): Implement the search algorithm using inline assemblyto find the index of a target value in an array.  
Exercise 3 (Linked-List Merge Sort, 40%): Implement merge sort for a linked list usinginline assembly. You will need to split the list, merge sorted lists, and move betweennodes.  

## Homework 2  
There are five exercises in this assignment.  
Exercise 1 (Fast Fourier Transform Calculation, 40%): Implement Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and collect the performance data using inline assembly.  
Exercise 2 (Array Multiplication with/without V extension, 40%)  
Exercise 2-1 (18%): Implement single floating-point array multiplication without V extension and collect the performance data using inline assembly.  
Exercise 2-2 (22%): Implement single floating-point array multiplication with Vextension, collect the performance data using inline assembly and compare theperformance with Exercise 2-1.  
Exercise 3 (Single/Double Floating-point Multiplication, 40%)  
Exercise 3-1 (16%): Implement single floating-point multiplication and collect performance data using inline assembly.  
Exercise 3-2 (24%): Implement double floating-point multiplication, collect performance data using inline assembly and compare the performance and relative error with Exercise 3-1.  

## Homework 3
Exercise 1. Implement FIFO Data Cache Replacement Policy  
You will implement the FIFO data cache replacement policy in the Spike simulator. Thisrequires the modification of the cache simulation code in the Spike simulator and rebuildingthe simulator.  
Exercise 2. Enhancing Software Programs to Reduce Memory Access Overhead   
You will optimize software programs to reduce memory access overhead based on the givencache configuration. Your optimized versions will be evaluated using the FIFO cachereplacement policy you implemented in Exercise 1.
